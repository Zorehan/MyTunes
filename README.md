## This project
The MyTunes assignment is a media player application developed from scratch. The application utilizes the Java programming language together with JavaFX for visuals and SQL for databases. The purpose for the application is for the user to be able to add .mp3 and .wav files to their song library, search between these songs, make playlists, and add songs to these playlists.
